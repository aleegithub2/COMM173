I worked at Best Buy when the PlayStation 3 came out. I noticed we were actually selling them for a little less than what we were purchasing them for. Some of the computers too. Turns out the profit margins are so high on the accessories and games that they were willing to take a small loss if it meant another consumer to buy all of those extras.,11

They place the section in a section of the store that makes it clear you walk by as much items as possible, to entice potential additional purchases. And in Wincos case, they keep their prices low by requiring certain fried chicken sets (we add these drums and wings for example always at a specific ratio) and to minimize waste as well. They also sell their fried chicken cold for a often more expensive price. ",

The reason why they sold the roasted chicken and cheap hot dogs was because of the long travel time for its customers.  Back when they started Costco's were sparse.  And sometimes you'd have to drive 45 minutes or more on the interstate. The cheap food sold at a loss was something for it's customers between the shopping and the long travel home.  The rotisserie chicken was also part of that idea.  A take away to be enjoyed at home for cheap.  Also, back in the early 90's, the chicken was 3.99.",

This is the point at which the demand and supply curves in the market intersect, and it's also where profit is maximized. That's why it's not always better to raise prices or lower them.",

The only real upside is that your still getting your monies worth in bulk.  And the normal supermarket outlets are charging as or nearly as much with well over a third less product. Its still better to shop at costco's.    Their are other players in the field thats much cheaper and also have good product.  Aldi's and Trader Joes  offer great value.",1

How many chickens do you need to buy to consider the 2 dollar savings by going to another store a real good deal. In a year you will need to buy 30 chickens just to break even, and then after that, you will start saving money. Also, other chains sells their beef at the same or lower price (similar quality) per pound and you don't have to buy it in bulk. By going to another store,  which name I won't mention,  I can buy the amount of meat I need and keep rotating it in my fridge.  I don't even have to freeze my meat.  It tastes more delicious.  I found myself eating frozen food from Costco for weeks on.  At the end,  it wasn't a good deal for my wallet or my belly.

They did all the raising, feeding, butchering, and cooking of the chicken. Even if you did use the chicken to get more chickens through breeding or get eggs through daily laying, it would still cost way more in terms of labor, time, and financial cost to raise and kill that chicken yourself than buy one from your local store. You could argue that it's shipping costs, but even then, refrigeration, transport, cooking, time, and labor costs seem heftier overall.",

Unless you're lucky or go first thing when they open, a trip to Costco will take a long time. You'l be spending time sitting in traffic jams in the parking lot, finding a spot to park, walking from the boonies to the door, navigating the walls of people surrounding the samples so you can get to the back of the store for chicken and back to the registers, waiting in line to check out, waiting in line to show your receipt to get out, walking back ton your car (if you can actually where you parked), and finally navigating the traffic jams to get out. With all that, you'l be lucky to get in and out in under half an hour. ",

Let's say it's been a slow day, and they pull the chickens that they don't want to sell to members any more, but are still good to eat. They flash chill the chickens, and then reuse the chicken for other items at Costco. You might find a tray of 6 drumsticks for $5, You might like our Chicken noodle soup, or our Chicken salad. also there are packages of just pure white meat chicken already cooked for you to use in a dish of your choosing. The only food that could be thrown out is when we make trays of chicken wings or ribs, which we normally save for the busier weekends. Sometimes the chickens are under the 3 pound weight and we'll even mark them down because of this. And that chicken farm she mentioned is only going to help Costco be able to sustain 40 percent of its supply chain. We are hoping that by doing this we can have a steadier supply of 3 pound chickens so we don't have to mark them down.",1

CostCo membership $60-120 a year. Walmart membership $0 a year. Most people don’t buy 60-120 baked chickens a year from those stores to make up the $1 difference. Walmart will have multiple stores in a city where there will only be 1 CostCo so Walmart will sell more baked chickens for $1 more and people won’t have to drive so far to save $1 on a baked chicken at CostCo.,

The reason the cooked chicken is so cheap is because the uncooked chickens are very perishable. Instead of throwing the expired uncooked chicken out, they cook it - and give it a new expiration.  This is done with all sorts of meats.  They take various cuts of meat, throw some spices on it and some bell pepper and onions, and sell it as ""ready to cook meals"" with a new expiration date.  Many stores do this.",

They don't get cheap chicken bc they invest more into them, they get cheap chickens bc they cheapen the chicken. That has a cause and effect on human health.

These types of chickens are the ones that farmers keep in those dark warehouses. They eat whatever the farmers feed them like corn and they even eat their own shit and they walk around in their own shit.. They don't have even space to walk around and they just sit because they are fed horomones to make their breast and thighs bigger. They can't support their own weight so they just sit around. That's why the chicken meat is so soft it's because they are inactive.,

It’s disgusting. They don’t look anything like they used to. These poor chickens are forced to grow in 6 weeks what they used to grow in 6 months. Their breast’s are so big and heavy that they can’t stand up. Their rib cages are almost flat. That’s torture! This is so WE can all “enjoy” a super cheap and easy meal without having to cook. Costco says they make no profit off these chickens so these little lives are only worth $4.99. It’s sick. I’m just as guilty because I know this and at time I cave in and buy one to make my own life easier. The guilt piles on as I start to see the bone structure of these poor animals. It’s so damn sad but who cares about stupid children’s, right? Well, we should ALL care!",
